# CS1470-Final-Project-J5
We implement Piano Genie model using Tensorflow 2.x Keras methods. For more information, follow these links:
* Piano Genie [Paper](./docs/Piano Genie Paper)
* Piano Genie Tensorflow Magenta [Blog Post](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/pianogenie)

The original model was implemented with Tensorflow 1.x with rooms for custom configurations, including different quantization techniques such as Variational Autoencoder and Integer Quantization with Straight Through. For this model, we plan to implement only the IQST. The project will focus mainly on creating a modular architecture using Keras for Piano Genie. Github forks for the original implementation can be found here:
